# FC-DOC — Component-documentation contract

> **Decision deliverable for Story 1.5 — and the one Epic-1 story whose deliverable is authoring
> *into* the CI-gated `docs/` DocFX site.** Unlike a build-from-scratch story, **the site, the gate,
> the components, and the three upstream contracts all already ship** at baseline `251a0b5`: `docs/`
> is a DocFX (Diataxis) site validated by `eng/validate-docs.ps1` (CI **Gate 2d**,
> `.github/workflows/ci.yml:191-195`) with `docfx 2.78.5` pinned (`.config/dotnet-tools.json`); the
> read-only-MVP shell components (layout, navigation, DataGrid surface, settings) are implemented and
> tested (`component-inventory.md` §A); and FC-LYT (1.2) / FC-A11Y (1.3) / FC-L10N (1.4) each shipped
> a contract under `_bmad-output/contracts/` that *deferred its published cross-link to Story 1.5*.
> What did **not** exist before this story: **per-component reference pages** under
> `docs/reference/components/`. This note therefore **(1) names the FC-DOC documentation contract**
> — the required-sections-per-component template + Gate-2d-conformant front-matter + nested-under-
> `Reference` placement + the cross-link convention — as the single ready-gate every later component
> doc points at, **(2) proves the contract is real** by authoring the validated anchor page
> (`FrontComposerShell`) plus a second conforming page (`Navigation`) and wiring them into
> `docs/toc.yml` without breaking the exactly-four-Diataxis-entries rule, **(3) records the component
> status map** (the AC2 coverage record / tracked-gap-with-owner mechanism), and **(4) escalates the
> two genuinely open items** with a named owner per AC3. Adopting FC-DOC introduces **zero behaviour
> change and no `src/` change**: it documents what the shell already does and pins how every future
> component page must be authored. **Enforcement is Gate 2d (`validate-docs.ps1`) itself — there is no
> bUnit "pin test" for this ready-gate the way 1.2–1.4 had; the docs validator *is* the gate.**

## The contract

The FC-DOC contract is **"required sections + Gate-2d-conformant front-matter + nested-under-Reference
placement + the inline-summarize cross-link convention," and naming that *is* the contract.** Every
published shell-component reference page MUST satisfy all of the following, and **passing
`eng/validate-docs.ps1` (Gate 2d) is the enforcement**:

- live under `docs/reference/components/`;
- carry the 7 required front-matter fields (all non-empty) **plus** a unique `uid` and `slug`;
- use `genre: reference` and `audience: adopter`;
- contain the required section set (Overview, Usage, Parameters / slots, Layout (FC-LYT),
  Accessibility (FC-A11Y), Localization (FC-L10N), Related);
- mark every ` ```csharp ` fence `compile` or `no-compile reason="…"` (adopter usage uses ` ```razor `);
- contain no unsafe text (no absolute private paths, tenant-id/secret literals, terminal control
  sequences);
- be wired into the `Reference > Components` TOC group and listed on `reference/components/index.md`.

### Required-sections-per-component template (the heart of AC1)

Every published component reference page MUST contain the following canonical section set:

| Required section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | One-paragraph "what it is / when to adopt it" — the source-free adoption summary. |
| **Usage** | Minimal adopter markup (a ` ```razor ` fence — see snippet rule) showing the component in place. |
| **Parameters / slots** | The public `[Parameter]` surface and named render-fragment slots (e.g. `FrontComposerShell`'s `HeaderStart/Center/End`, `Navigation`, `Footer`). |
| **Layout (FC-LYT)** | How the component behaves under the full-width vs constrained `<FcPageLayout>` contract; summarize the FC-LYT behavior inline. |
| **Accessibility (FC-A11Y)** | Which FC-A11Y primitives the component honors (skip-link targets, accessible names, `aria-live`, keyboard reachability); link the published `HFC1050`–`HFC1055` diagnostic pages under `docs/diagnostics/`. |
| **Localization (FC-L10N)** | Which strings are shell-owned (`IStringLocalizer<FcShellResources>`) vs host/domain-owned; the `services.Replace` swap seam. |
| **Related** | Cross-links to sibling component pages and relevant reference / concept pages. |

### Front-matter + placement + TOC + snippet rules (Gate-2d alignment, verbatim from `eng/validate-docs.ps1`)

- **Placement.** Published component pages live under `docs/reference/components/` (a new sub-area).
  The validator auto-discovers `reference/**/*.md` (`validate-docs.ps1:58-84`), so a new page is
  picked up and validated as soon as it lands.
- **Required front-matter (all 7, non-empty — `validate-docs.ps1:430-453`):** `title`,
  `description`, `genre` (must be `reference`), `audience` (must be `adopter`), `ownerStory`
  (`1-5-produce-the-fc-doc-component-documentation-contract`), `status` (`published`), `reviewed`
  (`2026-06-03`) — **plus** a stable `uid` **and** `slug` (mirror the existing reference pages:
  `uid: frontcomposer.reference.components.<name>`, `slug: reference/components/<name>/`). `uid`/`slug`
  are canonicalized (lower-cased, separators stripped) then collision-checked across the whole site
  (`:471-482`), so keep them unique.
- **Allowed genres / audiences (`:431-432, 455-461`):** `genre ∈ tutorial|how-to|reference|concept`;
  `audience ∈ adopter|framework-contributor|agent|operator`. Component pages are `reference` / `adopter`.
- **TOC rule — do NOT break (`:499-522`).** `docs/toc.yml` MUST keep **exactly four** top-level
  entries, in order: `Tutorials`, `How-to`, `Reference`, `Concepts`. Add component pages as **nested
  `items` under `Reference`** (a `Components` group, alongside the existing `Diagnostics` item) —
  **never** a 5th top-level entry, and **never** reorder the four. The validator throws if the
  top-level count ≠ 4 or the order differs.
- **Snippet rule (`:360-424`).** Every ` ```csharp ` fence is compiled by the validator against
  Contracts + Shell + Testing (a throwaway `net10.0` project, `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`) unless
  marked `no-compile reason="…"`; an **unmarked** or **reasonless** fence **fails the gate**. For
  component *usage* examples use a ` ```razor ` fence (not validated as C#) or
  ` ```csharp no-compile reason="illustrative adopter markup" `. Only use a bare `compile` C# fence
  if you genuinely want it built and have verified it compiles.
- **Unsafe-text rule (`:99-105, 484-487`).** No absolute private paths (`/home/...`, `C:\Users\...`),
  no `tenant-id` / `api-key` / `secret` / `password`-like literals, no terminal control sequences —
  the validator rejects the page body and any snippet on match.

### Component status map (the AC2 mechanism)

This table is both the AC2 coverage record and the "tracked gap with a named owner" mechanism for the
read-only-MVP component set. Epic 1 is **not yet closed** (Story 1.6 remains), so a documented
gap-with-owner is acceptable for this story; the anchor page is authored and validated to prove the
contract, and a second page (`Navigation`) is authored to demonstrate repeatability.

| Component area | Anchor component(s) | Doc page | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Layout & frame | `FrontComposerShell` (+ `FcPageLayout`, `FcHamburgerToggle`, `FcCollapsedNavRail`) | `docs/reference/components/front-composer-shell.md` | **authored (this story)** — Gate-2d-validated | FrontComposer |
| Navigation | `FrontComposerNavigation` | `docs/reference/components/navigation.md` | **authored (this story)** — Gate-2d-validated | FrontComposer + Tenants author |
| DataGrid surface | `FcColumnFilterCell`, `FcExpandInRowDetail`, `FcColumnPrioritizer`, filter family | `docs/reference/components/datagrid.md` *(not yet authored)* | **tracked gap** — defer to Epic 2 / FC-TBL (Story 2.8) when the table API is confirmed-stable | FrontComposer (FC-TBL, Story 2.8) |
| Settings | `FcSettingsDialog` (+ `FcThemeToggle`, `FcDensityPreviewPanel`) | `docs/reference/components/settings.md` *(not yet authored)* | **tracked gap** — defer to Story 1.6, which finalizes the settings / theme / density UX | FrontComposer (Story 1.6) |

**Rationale for the two gaps.** Authoring reference pages for components whose surface is about to be
finalized would publish documentation that contradicts the very next stories. DataGrid surface is
explicitly confirmed-stable under **FC-TBL (Story 2.8)**; settings UX is finalized by **Story 1.6**.
Per AC2, each is recorded here as a *tracked gap with a named owner* — the page is owed when its
governing story lands, not before. The anchor (`FrontComposerShell`) and `Navigation` are stable
read-only-MVP-central components, so they are authored now.

### Cross-link convention (the genuinely open item — surfaced, not silently resolved)

`_bmad-output/contracts/*` are **NOT part of the published DocFX site**, so a published page **cannot**
DocFX-xref them (DocFX resolves links within the site only). The FC-DOC contract therefore prescribes:

- a published component page **summarizes the relevant FC-LYT / FC-A11Y / FC-L10N behavior inline**
  (no broken link to `_bmad-output/`);
- it **links only to already-published siblings** — e.g. the `HFC1050`–`HFC1055` diagnostic pages
  under `docs/diagnostics/` for FC-A11Y enforcement, and sibling component pages;
- the **mapping from each published page → its governing `_bmad-output/contracts/*` source** is
  recorded in *this* FC-DOC contract (the traceability ledger below), **not** as a site link.

This is flagged as the **one cross-link-convention item** for the owner to confirm or override.

### Page → governing-contract traceability ledger

This ledger is the canonical mapping the published pages cannot themselves express as DocFX xrefs. It
closes the "FC-DOC linkage (deferred to Story 1.5)" forward-reference that FC-LYT, FC-A11Y, and
FC-L10N each left open.

| Published page | Summarizes / cross-references | Governing `_bmad-output/contracts/*` source |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/reference/components/front-composer-shell.md` | FC-LYT full-width vs constrained measure; FC-A11Y skip links / focus / `aria-live` / keyboard (links `HFC1050`–`HFC1055`); FC-L10N shell-vs-host string ownership + `services.Replace` swap seam | `fc-lyt-page-layout-2026-06-03.md`, `fc-a11y-accessibility-primitives-2026-06-03.md`, `fc-l10n-shell-string-ownership-2026-06-03.md` |
| `docs/reference/components/navigation.md` | FC-A11Y nav-rail accessible name + keyboard reachability (links `HFC1050`/`HFC1051`); FC-L10N nav strings shell-owned | `fc-a11y-accessibility-primitives-2026-06-03.md`, `fc-l10n-shell-string-ownership-2026-06-03.md` |

## Confirmation

**Status: ESCALATED (owner: FrontComposer + Tenants author — pending).** No live confirmation from the
named owner was available at implementation time. Per AC3, the contract is recorded as *escalated with
a named owner*; the required-section template, the Gate-2d front-matter / placement / TOC / snippet
rules, and the inline-summarize cross-link convention are **agreed and proven** (the anchor and
`Navigation` pages are authored and pass Gate 2d), and the following are the only genuinely open items:

1. **Cross-link convention — confirm "summarize inline + link published siblings; record the
   `_bmad-output` mapping in the FC-DOC ledger"?** Recommended and shipped (a published page cannot
   xref `_bmad-output/contracts/*`). Confirm or override.
2. **Author-now-vs-defer scope for the DataGrid surface and settings pages.** Recommended and applied:
   **defer** both as tracked gaps — DataGrid surface to **FC-TBL / Story 2.8** (confirm-stable table
   API), settings to **Story 1.6** (finalizes settings UX). Confirm the deferral or request the pages
   be authored now.

Owner column per the readiness request (`frontcomposer-readiness-request-2026-06-03.md:23`, 🔴 FC-DOC
row): **FrontComposer + Tenants author** ("component docs … every story's ready-gate"). Resolution
does **not** block Story 1.5 — AC3 explicitly permits escalate-with-owner, and FC-LYT / FC-A11Y /
FC-L10N all shipped `status: escalated` with a pending owner and passed review.

## Surface confirmed / pinned by Story 1.5

- **No new `src/` surface.** The components, the DocFX site, Gate 2d, and the three upstream contracts
  all pre-exist and are unchanged. This story adds **only** new `docs/` reference pages + this contract.
- **New published pages (Gate-2d-validated):** `docs/reference/components/index.md`,
  `docs/reference/components/front-composer-shell.md`, `docs/reference/components/navigation.md`.
- **Edited (additive, non-breaking):** `docs/toc.yml` (a `Components` group nested under `Reference`),
  `docs/reference/index.md` (a Components bullet).
- **Referenced, not modified:** the locked 7-parameter `FrontComposerShell` surface; the three
  `_bmad-output/contracts/fc-{lyt,a11y,l10n}-*.md` contracts; the `docs/diagnostics/HFC105*.md`
  pages; the gated baselines `docs/validation/producer-fingerprints.json` and
  `docs/validation/api-summary-baseline.txt` (byte-identical — this story adds no producer artifact
  and no public API).
